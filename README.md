# NoteGPT: Image Text Extraction Dashboard

This program is a note-taking tool designed to extract text from images, select a desired portion of the text, and produce a CSV with the extracted portion and a categorical summarization of the text. This tool is particularly useful for digitizing handwritten notes and organizing them using platforms such as Obsidian.

This tool was made to show the capabilities of combing pre-trained models available through different providers (Google and OpenAI), and expand the possible use cases.  You can easily create your own interactive dashboard and automate tedious processes such as uploading a ton of images.  Potential upgrades are detecting highlighted words, separating handwritten and printed notes, detecting underlined or bold words, and much more.
